# TimescaleDB sandbox

This repo is set up to familiarize myself with TimescaleDB.

Two tutorials are followed:

Part 1: Running a Docker Container with TimescaleDB, populating and querying data directly.

Part 2: Setting up an instance of TimescaleDB within Node.js utilizing express and sequelize.

Part 3: Same as part 2 but with a database set up for the MQTT data the database will store in the final app.
